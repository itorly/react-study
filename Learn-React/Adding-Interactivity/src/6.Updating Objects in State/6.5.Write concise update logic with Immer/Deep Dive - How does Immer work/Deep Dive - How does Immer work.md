#### Deep Dive - How does Immer work
The draft provided by Immer is a special type of object, called a Proxy, that “records” what you do with it. This is why you can mutate it freely as much as you like! Under the hood, Immer figures out which parts of the draft have been changed, and produces a completely new object that contains your edits.
