# Adjusting some state when a prop changes

## background: reset or adjust a part of the state on a prop change
Sometimes, you might want to reset or adjust a part of the state on a prop change, but not all of it.

This List component receives a list of items as a prop, and maintains the selected item in the selection state variable. You want to reset the selection to null whenever the items prop receives a different array:

## Avoid: Adjusting state on prop change in an Effect
```js
function List({ items }) {
  const [isReverse, setIsReverse] = useState(false);
  const [selection, setSelection] = useState(null);

  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: Adjusting state on prop change in an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    setSelection(null);
  }, [items]);
  // ...
}
```
