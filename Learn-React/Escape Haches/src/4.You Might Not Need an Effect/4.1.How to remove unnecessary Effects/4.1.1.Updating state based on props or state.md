When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, don’t put it in state. Instead, calculate it during rendering. 
```js
function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Taylor');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Swift');
  // ✅ Good: calculated during rendering
  const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName;
  // ...
}
```
