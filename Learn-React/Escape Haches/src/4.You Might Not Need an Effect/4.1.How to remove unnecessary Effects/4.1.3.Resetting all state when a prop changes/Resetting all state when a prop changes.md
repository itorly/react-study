# Resetting all state when a prop changes

## background
This ProfilePage component receives a userId prop. The page contains a comment input, and you use a comment state variable to hold its value. One day, you notice a problem: when you navigate from one profile to another, the comment state does not get reset. As a result, itâ€™s easy to accidentally post a comment on a wrong userâ€™s profile. To fix the issue, you want to clear out the comment state variable whenever the userId changes:

## Avoid: Resetting state on prop change in an Effect
```js
export default function ProfilePage({ userId }) {
  const [comment, setComment] = useState('');

  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: Resetting state on prop change in an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    setComment('');
  }, [userId]);
  // ...
}
```
This is inefficient because ProfilePage and its children will first render with the stale value, and then render again. It is also complicated because youâ€™d need to do this in every component that has some state inside ProfilePage. For example, if the comment UI is nested, youâ€™d want to clear out nested comment state too.

## Solution: a different profile, an explicit key
Instead, you can tell React that each userâ€™s profile is conceptually a different profile by giving it an explicit key. Split your component in two and pass a key attribute from the outer component to the inner one:
