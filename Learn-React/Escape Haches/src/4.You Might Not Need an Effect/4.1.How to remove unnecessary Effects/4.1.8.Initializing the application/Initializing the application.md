# React: Initializing the Application
## The Problem: One-Time Logic in Effects

Some logic should run only once when the app loads. You might be tempted to use an Effect:

```javascript
function App() {
  // ðŸ”´ Avoid: Effects with logic that should only ever run once
  useEffect(() => {
    loadDataFromLocalStorage();
    checkAuthToken();
  }, []);
}
```

### Why This Fails

- **Runs twice in development** due to Strict Mode
- Can cause issues (e.g., invalidating auth tokens not designed for multiple calls)
- Components should be resilient to remounting, including top-level `App`
