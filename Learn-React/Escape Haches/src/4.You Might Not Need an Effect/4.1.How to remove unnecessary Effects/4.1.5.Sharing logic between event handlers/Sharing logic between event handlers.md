# Sharing logic between event handlers

## Scenario
Let‚Äôs say you have a product page with two buttons (Buy and Checkout) that both let you buy that product. You want to show a notification whenever the user puts the product in the cart. Calling showNotification() in both buttons‚Äô click handlers feels repetitive so you might be tempted to place this logic in an Effect:

## Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
```js
function ProductPage({ product, addToCart }) {
  // üî¥ Avoid: Event-specific logic inside an Effect
  useEffect(() => {
    if (product.isInCart) {
      showNotification(`Added ${product.name} to the shopping cart!`);
    }
  }, [product]);

  function handleBuyClick() {
    addToCart(product);
  }

  function handleCheckoutClick() {
    addToCart(product);
    navigateTo('/checkout');
  }
  // ...
}
```
### Analysis: This Effect is unnecessary
This Effect is unnecessary. It will also most likely cause bugs. For example, let‚Äôs say that your app ‚Äúremembers‚Äù the shopping cart between the page reloads. If you add a product to the cart once and refresh the page, the notification will appear again. It will keep appearing every time you refresh that product‚Äôs page. This is because product.isInCart will already be true on the page load, so the Effect above will call showNotification().
