By default, Effects run after every render. This is why code like this will produce an infinite loop:

```js
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    useEffect(() => {
        setCount(count + 1);
    });
```

Effects run as a result of rendering. Setting state triggers rendering. Setting state immediately in an Effect is like plugging a power outlet into itself. The Effect runs, it sets the state, which causes a re-render, which causes the Effect to run, it sets the state again, this causes another re-render, and so on.

Effects should usually synchronize your components with an external system. If thereâ€™s no external system and you only want to adjust some state based on other state, you might not need an Effect.
