# useState vs useReducer Comparison

| Aspect | useState | useReducer |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Code Size** | ✅ Less code upfront<br/>• Simple state updates require minimal boilerplate<br/>• Direct state setting with `setState()` | ⚠️ More initial setup<br/>• Requires reducer function and action creators<br/>• ✅ Reduces code when multiple handlers share similar logic |
| **Readability** | ✅ Excellent for simple updates<br/>• Straightforward and intuitive<br/>• ❌ Can bloat component with complex state logic | ✅ Superior for complex state<br/>• Clean separation of "what happened" vs "how to update"<br/>• Centralizes state logic in reducer |
| **Debugging** | ❌ Harder to track state changes<br/>• Difficult to pinpoint incorrect state updates<br/>• Multiple `setState` calls scattered across component | ✅ Centralized debugging<br/>• Console logging in reducer shows all updates<br/>• Clear action-based state transitions<br/>• ❌ More code to step through |
| **Testing** | ❌ Component-dependent testing<br/>• State logic tied to component lifecycle<br/>• Requires component rendering for testing | ✅ Isolated testing<br/>• Reducer is a pure function<br/>• Can test state logic independently<br/>• Easier to write comprehensive test cases |
| **Performance** | ✅ Minimal overhead<br/>• Direct state updates<br/>• No additional function calls | ⚠️ Slight overhead<br/>• Action dispatching and reducer execution<br/>• ✅ Better optimization for complex updates |
| **State Structure** | ✅ Perfect for primitive values<br/>• Ideal for independent state pieces<br/>• ❌ Can become unwieldy with related state | ✅ Excellent for complex/related state<br/>• Handles state objects and arrays well<br/>• Natural fit for state machines |
| **Learning Curve** | ✅ Beginner-friendly<br/>• Matches class component `setState` pattern<br/>• Immediate understanding | ❌ Steeper learning curve<br/>• Requires understanding of reducer pattern<br/>• Redux-like mental model |

## When to Choose Each

### Use `useState` when:
- State updates are simple and independent
- Working with primitive values (strings, numbers, booleans)
- Building simple components or prototypes
- Team prefers straightforward state management

### Use `useReducer` when:
- State logic is complex with multiple related updates
- State depends on previous state values
- Multiple event handlers modify state similarly
- Need predictable state transitions
- Debugging complex state bugs
- Building state machines or complex forms

## Best Practices

**Flexibility**: You can mix both hooks in the same component based on specific needs. Start with `useState` for simplicity and refactor to `useReducer` when complexity grows.

**Migration**: Converting between `useState` and `useReducer` is straightforward - they're equivalent in functionality but differ in organization and structure.
